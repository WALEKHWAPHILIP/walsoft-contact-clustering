title: "Walsoft Contact-Level Clustering"
---

## Business objective

Segment contacts into actionable behavioral groups to support outreach planning, CRM prioritization, and relationship management.

## What changes after you deploy this pipeline

- You stop treating all contacts the same.
- You get stable, interpretable contact segments that drive outreach cadence, prioritization, and risk flags.
- You can justify communication decisions using measurable behavioral signals (call volume, duration, timing, recency, and gaps).

## How this project is structured

This project is deliberately split into two layers:

- **Decision layer (this site)** — explains *why* the segmentation exists and *how* it supports real business decisions.
- **Analytical layer (next chapter)** — shows the full, reproducible unsupervised learning pipeline, from raw call logs to validated contact clusters.

Open the chapter: **Walsoft Contact Segmentation**.
