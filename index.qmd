title: "Walsoft Contact-Level Clustering"
---

## Business objective

Segment contacts into actionable behavioral groups to support outreach planning, CRM prioritization, and relationship management.

## What you get

- Stable, interpretable contact segments that drive outreach cadence, prioritization, and risk flags
- Justification for decisions using measurable behavioral signals (volume, duration, timing, recency, and gaps)
- Reproducible pipeline with robustness checks (not just clustering plots)

## How this project is structured

This project is split into two layers:

- **Decision layer (this site)** — explains why the segmentation exists and how it supports business decisions
- **Analytical layer (next chapter)** — the full pipeline from call logs to validated clusters
